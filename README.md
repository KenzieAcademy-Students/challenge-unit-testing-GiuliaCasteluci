# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Unit Testing

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is the **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives? I consider using Jest but could not make it work for some reason, ill definitely try again next assginment. Also, for the functions i just tried to keep it simple  using the basic and modern array methods such as 
    .split(" ") ; filter(); reverse(); join(" "); or even for loop when necessary
